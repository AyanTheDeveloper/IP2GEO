# IP2GEO
## Usage and testing:
`IP2GEO.IP2GEO i2g = new IP2GEO.IP2GEO();`
now you can use it by:
`Console.WriteLine(i2g.Locate());`
this returns the country name + country code
`Console.WriteLine(i2g.LocateCountryNameOnly());`
only country name is returned
`Console.WriteLine(i2g.LocateCountryCodeOnly());`

this also works in winforms, `IP2GEO.IP2GEO i2g = new IP2GEO.IP2GEO();` and use "i2g" to use it.
